/-- The empty type represents absolute nothingness -/
inductive Nothing : Type where
  -- No constructors - this type has no inhabitants

/-- Recognition structure: A can distinguish elements of B -/
structure Recognition (A B : Type) where
  recognizer : A
  recognized : B

/-- The meta-principle: Nothing cannot recognize itself -/
def meta_principle_holds : Prop := ¬∃ (_ : Recognition Nothing Nothing), True

/-- Physical realizability through finite cardinality -/
structure Finite (A : Type) where
  n : Nat
  elements : Fin n → A
  surjective : ∀ a : A, ∃ i : Fin n, elements i = a

theorem foundation2_to_foundation3 : Foundation2_DualBalance → Foundation3_PositiveCost := by

theorem foundation3_to_foundation4 : Foundation3_PositiveCost → Foundation4_UnitaryEvolution := by
