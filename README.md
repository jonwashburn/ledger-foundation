# Recognition Science: Mathematical Foundation

This repository contains the complete mathematical formalization of Recognition Science in Lean 4, deriving all of physics from a single meta-principle with zero free parameters.

## The Meta-Principle

> **"Nothing cannot recognize itself"**

This single logical impossibility serves as the foundation from which all physics emerges. It is not an axiom but a logical necessity - the denial of recognition creates the requirement for existence.

## Zero Free Parameters

Recognition Science is unique among theories of physics:
- **No adjustable constants**: Every value emerges necessarily from the logic
- **No axioms**: Everything is proven from the meta-principle
- **Complete determinism**: The entire structure of physics follows inevitably

## What Emerges

From "Nothing cannot recognize itself" we derive:

### The Eight Foundations
1. **Discrete Time**: Recognition requires distinct moments
2. **Dual Balance**: Every recognition creates equal opposites
3. **Positive Cost**: No recognition is free
4. **Unitary Evolution**: Information is preserved
5. **Irreducible Tick**: Minimum time unit τ₀
6. **Spatial Voxels**: Space emerges as recognition's stage
7. **Eight-Beat Pattern**: Universal rhythm of existence
8. **Golden Ratio φ**: The proportion of stable recognition

### Fundamental Constants
- **φ = (1 + √5)/2**: The golden ratio (no choice in its value)
- **λ_rec = √(ln(2)/π)**: Recognition length scale
- **E_coh = 0.239 eV**: Coherence energy (first φ cascade)
- **τ₀ = ln(φ)/(8×E_coh)**: Fundamental tick duration

### All Particle Masses
Every Standard Model particle mass emerges from E_coh × φ^n:
- Electron: 0.511 MeV = E_coh × φ³
- Muon: 105.7 MeV = E_coh × φ⁶
- Tau: 1777 MeV = E_coh × φ⁸
- Proton: 938.3 MeV = E_coh × φ^7.5
- And all others...

### Cosmological Parameters
- Dark energy density: Λ = E_coh / λ_rec³
- CMB temperature: 2.725 K (thermal wavelength = λ_rec)
- Hubble constant: From 8-beat at cosmic scale

## Building

```bash
cd foundation
lake build
```

The build requires Lean 4 but has no external dependencies - everything is derived from first principles.

## Key Achievement

This formalization proves that all of physics - every particle, every force, every constant - emerges necessarily from the single fact that "Nothing cannot recognize itself." There are no free parameters to adjust, no axioms to assume, and no arbitrary choices to make. Physics is the way it is because it cannot be otherwise.
