  Recognition Science: The Meta-Principle (Minimal)
  ================================================

  This file contains only the minimal definitions needed for the meta-principle.
  No external dependencies, no mathematical machinery - just pure logic.

## Core Definitions

We define recognition and nothingness at the most fundamental level.
-/

/-- The empty type represents absolute nothingness -/
inductive Nothing : Type where
  -- No constructors - this type has no inhabitants

/-- Recognition is a relationship between a recognizer and what is recognized -/
structure Recognition (A : Type) (B : Type) where
  recognizer : A
  recognized : B

## The Meta-Principle

The foundational impossibility from which everything emerges.
-/

/-- The meta-principle: Nothing cannot recognize itself -/
def MetaPrinciple : Prop :=
  ¬∃ (r : Recognition Nothing Nothing), True

/-- The meta-principle holds by the very nature of nothingness -/
theorem meta_principle_holds : MetaPrinciple := by
  -- We need to show that ¬∃ r, True, i.e., there is no Recognition Nothing Nothing
  intro h
  -- h : ∃ r, True means there exists some r : Recognition Nothing Nothing
  obtain ⟨rec, _⟩ := h
  -- But rec.recognizer has type Nothing, which has no inhabitants
  nomatch rec.recognizer
