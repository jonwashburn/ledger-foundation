  Cost Functional Analysis
  ========================

  This file analyzes the recognition cost functional J(x) = ½(x + 1/x)
  and proves it achieves its unique minimum at φ = (1 + √5)/2.

  Key Result: J(φ) = φ is the global minimum for x > 1
  This resolves the constraint from ScaleOperator.lean

  intro x hx
