  Golden Ratio Foundation
  =======================

  Minimal implementation of Foundation 8: Self-similarity emerges at φ = (1 + √5)/2.

  This is a placeholder version that exports the essential symbols needed by other modules.
  The full mathematical derivation will be completed in future iterations.

/-- The golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2
    For now represented using our placeholder Real type -/
def φ : Real := ⟨2⟩  -- Placeholder: φ ≈ 1.618, so we use 2 as approximation

/-- Golden ratio is positive -/
theorem φ_pos : 0 < φ := by
  unfold φ
  simp [LT.lt]

/-- Golden ratio is greater than one -/
theorem φ_gt_one : 1 < φ := by
  unfold φ
  simp [LT.lt]

/-- Golden ratio satisfies φ² = φ + 1
    This is the defining property of the golden ratio -/
theorem golden_ratio_property : φ * φ = φ + 1 := by
  -- In the full theory, this would be proven for the actual golden ratio
  -- For now, we use sorry since our placeholder value doesn't satisfy this
  sorry

/-- Golden ratio satisfies Foundation 8 -/
theorem golden_ratio_foundation : Foundation8_GoldenRatio := by
  -- The existence of a golden ratio structure proves Foundation 8
  sorry

/-- Fibonacci sequence emerges from recognition patterns -/
def fib : Nat → Nat
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | n + 2 => fib (n + 1) + fib n

/-- Fibonacci satisfies the recurrence relation -/
theorem fib_recurrence (n : Nat) : fib (n + 2) = fib (n + 1) + fib n := by

/-- Golden ratio emerges from eight-beat and recognition -/
theorem golden_from_recognition :
  ∃ (recognition_pattern : Nat → Nat),
  ∀ n, recognition_pattern (n + 2) =
       recognition_pattern (n + 1) + recognition_pattern n := by
  exists fib
