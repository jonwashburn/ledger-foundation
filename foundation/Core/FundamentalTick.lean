  Fundamental Tick Derivation
  ===========================

  The fundamental tick τ₀ emerges from the requirement that
  8 ticks must support the golden ratio energy cascade.

## The Eight-Beat Constraint

The 8-beat cycle must allow φ-scaling between energy levels.
This constrains the fundamental tick duration.
-/

/-- Eight ticks must support golden ratio scaling -/
theorem eight_beat_scaling_requirement :
  ∃ (τ : ℝ), τ > 0 ∧
  exp (8 * τ * E_coh_derived) = φ := by
  -- From 8-beat closure: exp(8τE) = φ
  -- Taking logs: 8τE = ln(φ)
  -- So τ = ln(φ)/(8E)
  sorry -- Requires exponential calculations

/-- The fundamental tick interval -/
def τ₀_derived : ℝ := log φ / (8 * E_coh_derived)

/-- τ₀ is positive -/
theorem τ₀_pos : 0 < τ₀_derived := by
  unfold τ₀_derived
  apply Real.div_pos
  · -- log φ > 0 since φ > 1
    apply Real.log_pos
    exact φ_gt_one  -- From GoldenRatio
  · apply Real.mul_pos
    · norm_num
    · exact E_coh_pos

## Planck Constant Emerges

With E_coh and τ₀, we can derive ℏ.
-/

/-- The reduced Planck constant emerges from recognition -/
def ℏ_derived : ℝ := 2 * π * E_coh_derived * τ₀_derived

/-- Dimensional check: E × t = action -/
theorem planck_dimension_check :
  -- In natural units, [E_coh] = 1/length and [τ₀] = length
  -- So [E_coh × τ₀] = dimensionless, which is correct for ℏ = 1
  ℏ_derived = 2 * π * (χ / λ_rec) * (log φ / (8 * χ / λ_rec)) := by
  unfold ℏ_derived τ₀_derived E_coh_derived
  sorry -- Algebraic simplification

/-- Simplified form of ℏ -/
theorem planck_simplified :
  ℏ_derived = π * log φ / 4 := by
  unfold ℏ_derived τ₀_derived E_coh_derived χ
  sorry -- Algebraic simplification
