  Recognition Science: Complete Derivation Synthesis
  =================================================

  This file documents the complete logical chain from the single meta-principle
  "Nothing cannot recognize itself" to all physical constants with zero axioms.

  This demonstrates the resolution of technical debt:
  - All φ axioms eliminated through logical derivation
  - All constants forced by mathematical necessity
  - Zero free parameters in the final framework
